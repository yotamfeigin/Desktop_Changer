## DESKTOP CHANGER ##
DesktopChanger is an application written in python3.7
What is it designated to do you ask ? Well,
The program is used to change the background of your Desktop to random photos fetched by an API by unsplash (https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo)

## Would love to accept any contibutions\reviews on it ##

### Expanding plans ###
Currently the program only works with randomized photo, in the near future i'd like to expand the program.
I'd give the user more power to modify the way the API chooses background (Let's say it will take a key-word \ A certain theme and fetch photos according to it)
